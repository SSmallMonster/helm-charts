[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/5685/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/5685) [![Artifact Hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/hwameistor)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=hwameistor)


This functionality is in alpha and is subject to change. The code is provided as-is with no warranties. Alpha features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

## Modules

The HwameiStor consists of three part at present,include Local-Disk-Manager,Local-Storage and Scheduler.

### Local-Disk-Manager

Local-Disk-Manager(LDM) is designed to hold the management of disks on nodes.Other modules such as Local-Storage can take advantage of the management of disks by LDM.See more at [LDM](https://github.com/hwameistor/local-disk-manager/blob/main/README.md#local-disk-manager-ldm)

### Local-Storage

Local-Storage provides a cloud native local storage system.It aims to provision high performance persistent LVM volume with local access to applicatios.See more at [LS](https://github.com/hwameistor/local-storage#local-storage-module)

### Scheduler

The Scheduler is to automatically schedule the Pod to the correct node which has the associated HwameiStor volume.See more at [Scheduler](https://github.com/hwameistor/scheduler#hwameistor-scheduler)

## Usage

### STEP 1: Install HwameiStor

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/hwameistor/helm-charts.git
```

```console
$ cd helm-charts/charts
```

```console
$ helm install hwameistor -n hwameistor --create-namespace --generate-name
```

or:

```console
$ helm repo add hwameistor http://hwameistor.io/helm-charts
```

```console
$ helm install hwameistor/hwameistor -n hwameistor --create-namespace --generate-name
```

You can then run `helm search repo hwameistor` to see the charts.
##Roadmap
See road map at [Roadmap](https://github.com/hwameistor/helm-charts/blob/main/doc/roadmap.md)
### STEP 2: Enable HwameiStor On Node

Once the Helm charts was installed. You should enable HwameiStor on specific nodes as follows:

```console
$ kubectl label node <node-name> "lvm.hwameistor.io/enable=true"
```

### STEP 3: Claim Disk By Type On Node

Then claim disk for your local-storage by apply LocalDiskClaim CR:

```console
cat > ./local-disk-claim.yaml <<- EOF
apiVersion: hwameistor.io/v1alpha1
kind: LocalDiskClaim
metadata:
  name: <anyname>
  namespace: hwameistor
spec:
  nodeName: <node-name>
  description:
    diskType: <HDD or SSD or NVMe>
EOF
```

```console
$ kubectl apply -f ./local-disk-claim.yaml
```

**Congratulations! HwameiStor is now deployed on your cluster.**
